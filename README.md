Internet of Trash was a project conceived for the Minor course Innovation and Research at Fontys Venlo. It offers a proof of concept solution for smart waste containers in the city, allowing ultrasound sensors to measure how full the containers are and sending that information to a server via a LoRaWAN network. Garbage collection companies could then be alerted when a container is full or nearly full and calculate optimal collection routes on the website. Citizens could also use the website to view how full their local container is. 

This project contains the NodeJS package that the IoT website uses to GET and POST data to a REST API.
